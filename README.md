### Category I  
**1. Outlined drawings of characters or objects in your video.**  
**EXTRA CREDIT: Painting effects, which you draw over the image on a frame-by-frame basis, perhaps to make it appear drawn**  
For this category, I outlined my figurines and added eyes (bullet 1). For my extra credit, I painted changing patterns over the background (bullet 7).    

### Category II  
**1. Some interesting non-linear image warp.**
For this category, I created a vertical and horizontal sinusoidal warp across my video.  

### Category III  
N/A  

### Files (Input)  
My input files are a video of me dancing and a 35 second excerpt of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake Waltz.  
The output, as seen in each category, is an edited video where my dancing is animated, my body is warped, and my pants are pink.
