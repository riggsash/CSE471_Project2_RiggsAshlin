### Category I  
For this category, I animated my dancing to add motion/wind behind my legs as I kicked.  

### Category II  
For this category, I warped the first 5 seconds of the video. I cut off the warp after 5 seconds because I thought it would be annoying and hard to see the rest of the video.  

### Category III  
For this category, I keyed the green in my pants to make them pink.  

### Files (Input)  
My input files are a video of me dancing and a 35 second excerpt of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake Waltz.  
The output, as seen in each category, is an edited video where my dancing is animated, my body is warped, and my pants are pink.
