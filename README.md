### Category I  
**1. Outlined drawings of characters or objects in your video.**  
**EXTRA CREDIT: Painting effects, which you draw over the image on a frame-by-frame basis, perhaps to make it appear drawn**  
For this category, I outlined my figurines and added eyes (bullet 1). For my extra credit, I painted changing patterns over the background (bullet 7).  

### Category II  
**1. Some interesting non-linear image warp.**  
For this category, I created a vertical and horizontal sinusoidal warp across my video.  

### Category III  
N/A  

### Files (Input)  
My input files are a video of me showing my figurines and a voiceover mp3. They were too big to add to github, so they are in my submission zip file inside of the **____** Folder
